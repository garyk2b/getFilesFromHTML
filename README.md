# getFilesFromHTML
Get Files from HTML

This Python tool will download files for a given file type (extension) from an HTML web page.  It can be useful when sharing lots of files on an HTML page.

Enter a website URL and a file extension type (e.g. zip, jpg, kmz) into the field options and click Submit.  The tool will download the files from the page by searching for any link tags or embedded images on the page.  A downloads directory will be created where the tool exists.  This tool will NOT find any dynamic content such as ASPX or PHP and will not work on FTP protocol pages.

Created using the Beautiful Soup library for finding HTML content. GUI built with TKinter.

Run getFilesFromHTML.py to get started.
